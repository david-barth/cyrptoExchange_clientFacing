# cyrptoExchange_clientFacing
The client facing module for the crypto exchange project


//Current TODOs:

    ---> Introduce a couple of endpoints in order to experiment with MongoDB queries: 

            A. Get exchanges by complex query via post request for subset of exchanges: 

                1. Exchange name

                2. Price range (price usd) => x <= price <= y

                3. Symbol




            B. Obtain total price over all exchanges (Simple Aggregation Example) 



//Future TODOS: 

    ---> Figure out warning issues on startup and correct if necessary. 

    ---> Make a conversion of current application.properties to application.yml
