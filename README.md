//Current TODOs:

    ---> Introduce a couple of endpoints in order to experiment with MongoDB queries: 


            B. Design a data transfer mechanism between the MySQL DB and MongoDB.


                ---> Idea: 


                        6. Configure a cron job in order to load there every x minutes (precise amount - tbd). 





            C. Consider and implement unit test cases. 




//Future TODOS: 

    ---> Figure out warning issues on startup and correct if necessary.
